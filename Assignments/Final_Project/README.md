# Final Project

## Overview

Each team will work to create a minimum viable product (MVP) to
address one of the mentor's challenge problems. The UNIV students
have been working with the mentors to understand the challenge problem
and develop an initial direction for the project. As a team, your
goal is to create an MVP that can be demoed as part of your final
presentation in class on either Dec. 6 or 8. Each team will also
create a narrated video that demonstrates their MVP.

Class periods will be dedicated to immersion in the software engineering 
process via stand-up meetings, coding, and reviews. Teams and individuals will be 
graded heavily on how well they demonstrate incremental progress using an Agile 
process. Each team member is required to demonstrate his/her contribution to the 
team's incremental progress through concrete artifacts. For CS students, 
team members must make and push commits to the team's GitHub repo. For UNIV students, 
the communication with the instructor, Trello, video, etc. will be used to gauge progress.

Each class period, every team must meet and hold a stand-up meeting facilitated
by the university student. The goals of the stand-up meeting are to discuss
the current user stories and backlog, as well as plan next steps. All team members
are required to attend the stand-up meetings. If your team is
meeting with the instructor during class, your team should meet in the classroom. 
If your team is not meeting with the instructor that day, you may hold your stand-up meeting
anywhere that they would like. You can schedule access to a conference room in the Innovation Center
by contacting Deanna Meador (deanna.n.meador@vanderbilt.edu). All team members are
expected to attend and contribute to the stand-up meeting.  Team members are free to 
use any remaining class time to complete their individual contributions to the project 
for the class period and push them to the GitHub repo. 

Every other class period, your team will meet with the instructor to discuss progress
and challenges that you are facing. During these meetings, each team member will 
present their contributions since the prior meeting. For CS students, please make 
sure that you have your commits open in GitHub and are prepared to discuss your
code / design. In addition to presenting individual contributions, each team should
demo the progress from the prior demo. The meeting schedules are listed below.

## CS Student Duties

+ Commit code every class period. You should create a branch with the exact
name daily/firstname_lastname. You will receive a grade that is X/10, where
X is the number of class periods that you committed code out of the 10 class
periods that you were expected to commit code. The goal is to foster
incremental progress with a minimum of two commits per week. You can create 
the actual changes included in the commit any time between the prior commit 
and the end of the following class. However, the commits need to be pushed 
to the team's remote repo within 30min of the end of each class period. Each 
class period commit should have work roughly equivalent to a minimum of 
1-2hrs of effort. 

+ Merge new code into the master branch at least once per week. 

+ Focus on generating iterative demonstrable progress.

+ Work with non-CS students in the implementation of
  a complex software product.

+ Aid in the creation of the final project video.

+ Aid in the production and presentation of the final demo.

+ Attend the stand-up meetings in class and provide input on
  the status of your user stories.

+ Be prepared to discuss your code contributions each week during
  your meeting with the instructor.

+ Learn new frameworks as necessary to implement the minimum
  viable product for your project.

+ The bulk of your work will be contained within the user stories
  that are created for your project.

## UNIV Student Duties

+ You will serve the role of product owner / facilitator
throughout the development. Your goal will be to help shape the
development process so that it leads to a successful prototype
solution. You want to "facilitiate" and not "dictate" development. The
goal is to keep the group coordinated, communicating, on-task, and
building towards a solution that will effectively address the mentor's
challenge problem. Your goal isn't to "tell people what to do" but
instead to facilitate discussions so that the group evenly divides up
the work and makes consistent progress against the deliverables. You 
will then foster open dialogue around progress and help the group 
identify and eliminate bottlenecks.

+ You will be facilitating an agile development process with the CS students.

+ You will maintain and organize the user stories based on feedback
from your group and the mentor.

+ You will advocate for demonstrable progress (e.g., demos that can be
shown to the instructors or the mentors). When your team proposes a
purely technical goal, ask how they can demo that goal or reorganize
the plan to make it visible to the instructors / mentor. You want to
ensure that every week there is something to show and get feedback on.

+ You will track progress in each sprint using Trello to organize
lists of completed, current, and backlog user stories.

+ In each class, you will work to facilitate a stand-up meeting with
your team and go through the status of the current user stories.
Please read Martin Fowler's article on stand up meetings to help
understand the goal of the stand-up:
http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html.

+ At the end of the stand-up meeting, send a direct Slack message to the instructor and
the TA that includes: 1) the list of all team members, 2) the list of team members 
that attended the stand-up meeting, and 3) the user stories that were completed 
since the previous meeting. 

+ Once a week, you will have a group meeting with the instructor
during class. During this meeting, you will demo the completed user
stories. 

+ You will setup a meeting schedule with the mentor to keep them
apprised of progress by showing them incremental demos and the user
story status.

+ You will be the chief marketing officer of the project and will
will take the lead in guiding your team to develop a video to showcase 
your project. A great example of a student project marketing video is 
Jasper (https://jasperproject.github.io/).

+ You will send a weekly progress assessment email (in addition to the
one-on-one meetings) to "upper management" to assure them that things
are progressing smoothly (e.g., stories are being accomplished, you 
are getting needed answers from mentors, etc.).
Please send these emails to the instructors and we will forward them
on to upper management. If there are issues that we need to be aware
of, please feel free to reach out about them earlier, but these emails
are also a great place to list them. All of these emails will be
confidential.
